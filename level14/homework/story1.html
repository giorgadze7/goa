    <h1>Santa’s Favorite Story</h1>
    <p>
        Summary: In the story, “Santa’s Favorite Story” by Hisako Aoki, a fox discovers Santa Claus asleep in the forest
        and fetches other animals. When Santa wakes up, he shares the story of the first Christmas and the true meaning
        of the holiday – God’s gift of love. Inspired, Santa and the animals prepare for Christmas together, reminding
        readers that the essence of the season is love, not presents.

        One cold day in December a fox was walking in the forest. As he looked at the snowy trees, he remembered that it
        would soon be Christmas. Then he heard something. He sniffed the air and looked around.

        There fast asleep against a tree, was Santa Claus! He was snoring. “Oh my goodness!’ thought the fox, “Santa
        Claus has come early this year. I’d better go and tell everyone he’s here.” So he hurried off to tell all the
        other animals that lived in the forest.

        When they heard the news, the animals hopped and ran and scampered and flew to the tree. A squirrel chattered
        excitedly, and Santa Claus slowly stretched, yawned, and then opened his eyes to see the faces of a dozen little
        creatures.
